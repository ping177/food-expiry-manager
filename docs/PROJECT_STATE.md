食品过期管理

## Repo path

`/Users/wp/Projects/食品过期管理`

## Current version

v0.2.10 implemented locally: Email OTP Authentication Flow, pending human review and Production acceptance.

## Current status

v0.2.10 已完成本地实现与自动化/生产构建验证，等待人工 review 和 Production OTP 验收；v0.2.9 保活链路保持已验收状态。

## Latest completed

v0.2.10 将登录 UI 从 Magic Link 改为两阶段 Email OTP：发送阶段保留 `signInWithOtp()` 和 `shouldCreateUser: true`，不再传递 `emailRedirectTo`；验证阶段使用 `verifyOtp({ email, token, type: 'email' })`。原有 session 恢复、auth listener、user ID 变化检测、库存 stale guard 和登出清理保持不变。未修改 schema、migration、RLS 或业务数据逻辑。

## Deployment

Status: deployed
Public URL: https://food-expiry-manager-two.vercel.app/
Provider: Vercel
Notes: Vercel uses Vite, root directory `.`, build command `npm run build`, output directory `dist`.

## Last verified

2026-07-10: v0.2.9 Production keepalive acceptance completed: Cron registered, migration deployed, `CRON_SECRET` configured server-side, unauthorized browser access returned 401, and first automatic keepalive produced three Supabase RPC 200 logs.

## Next Action

Review v0.2.10 diff，然后部署并在 iOS 主屏幕 standalone Web App 完成 Email OTP 登录、刷新恢复、退出和同邮箱库存恢复验收；通过后再恢复图片上传候选的方案设计。

## Blockers

None.

## Important Context

- Core model separates `products` from `inventory_batches`; same product can have multiple independent batches.
- Every inventory entry must result in an `expiry_date`.
- App no longer creates new anonymous users when no session exists; email OTP is now the default login path.
- Existing anonymous sessions were only a migration bridge; current formal inventory owner is the permanent email account.
- Old anonymous business data was migrated by changing `products.user_id` and `inventory_batches.user_id` to the permanent account in a fail-closed SQL transaction; product IDs and batch `product_id` references were preserved.
- Supabase Free may pause after inactivity; recovery window details must come from real email or Dashboard, not estimates.
- Vercel Production URL is https://food-expiry-manager-two.vercel.app/.
- Vercel frontend environment variables are limited to `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`; service role keys and Go-UPC API keys must not be exposed to the frontend.
- Supabase Production Site URL / Redirect URL are configured; local `localhost:5177` and `127.0.0.1:5177` redirects remain available for local testing.
- v0.2.10 keeps `detectSessionInUrl` unchanged for possible future Auth flows, but Email OTP no longer supplies `emailRedirectTo` or requires a URL callback. Supabase Auth + Resend SMTP and the hosted email template have been configured outside Git to send `{{ .Token }}`.
- Migrated test inventory was cleared by the user in Supabase for the permanent email account only; the permanent Auth user was kept. Local pre-migration JSON backup remains outside Git.
- v0.2.9 uses a daily Vercel Cron scheduled as `17 4 * * *`; on Hobby it runs once during the UTC 04:00-04:59 window, not necessarily at 04:17.
- The Cron endpoint uses server-only `CRON_SECRET`; the anon RPC is intentionally public but only returns `true` and has no business-data access or write effects. No service role key is used.
- Browser access without Authorization returns 401 / `{"ok":false}`, which is the expected protected behavior.
- Production acceptance confirmed the first automatic keepalive chain: Vercel Cron → `/api/supabase-keepalive` → `CRON_SECRET` auth → 3 read-only `keepalive_ping()` RPC calls → Supabase API Logs with three `POST /rest/v1/rpc/keepalive_ping` 200 entries.
- Cron failure only affects that keepalive run and does not block normal App login, inventory, or barcode scanning.
- Documentation ownership: `README.md` is the entrypoint; `ROADMAP` is long-term route; `BACKLOG` is near-term priority; `BARCODE_API_EVALUATION` and `DATA_MODEL` remain dedicated specialist docs; `DECISIONS` records key decisions.
- v0.2.1 Go-UPC Edge Function integration is complete and deployed.
- Go-UPC API key must stay in Supabase Edge Function server-side secret `GO_UPC_API_KEY`; never expose it through Vite frontend env vars.
- Current external lookup order is local `products` → Go-UPC Edge Function → Open Food Facts universal → Open Pet Food Facts → normal Open Food Facts → manual entry.
- Barcode Lookup is a possible future fallback, not implemented.
- EAN-Search / EAN-Suche is a possible future `suggested_match` fallback, not implemented.
- Go-UPC category can be too generic for pet food, e.g. `Snack Foods`; third-party category is ignored by the frontend and is not saved or prefilled into the category selector.
- Saved product information is reused locally by barcode; users can now edit saved product display fields from the inventory batch detail view.
- Product editing updates `products` only. Quantity correction and “消耗 1” in detail update the selected `inventory_batches` row only. `inventory_batches` remain separate and keep their own expiry date and status.
- Home filtering operates on active batches and combines expiry time window, category, and product/brand search while preserving the existing expiry-date ordering.
- Home cards intentionally stay summary-only: product image/name, category, remaining quantity, expiry date, and expiry-window badge. Brand and barcode remain detail-level information.
- Product data APIs must not infer shelf life.
- Direct phone photo or album image upload is the next candidate; it likely needs Supabase Storage, compression, Storage RLS, upload / replace / delete, and orphan-file cleanup design.

## Handoff Prompt

Review and manually accept v0.2.10 Email OTP in the deployed app, especially the iOS standalone Web App flow. Do not modify schema, RLS, business tables, anonymous-user cleanup results, or Supabase Dashboard settings as part of that review.
